# RenaissancePack---A-Dying-Light-RPack-Extractor-and-Repacker
Hello, this project allows you to extract, edit, and repack Dying Light RPack texture files. I will try to add more and more textures each day.

In order to use the program correctly, you must do the following:
-If the texture is a regular texture, make sure you save it as DXT1
-If the texture is a NRM or SPC texture, you must save it as DXT5
-Make sure the name of your texture is "extractionrpack.dds"
-Make sure that common_textures_0_pc.rpack is in the same folder as the program for extraction
-Make sure that extractionrpack.dds is in the same folder as the program for repacking

Please note the following:
-This only works with common_textures_0_pc.rpack as of now
-This only has a few textures as of now, but I will try to add more and more each day
-The map textures will only appear when you are close to them in-game (this probably has to do with baked lighting)

I have also included the source code if you want to take a look at that and possibly add your own textures.
